# Cybersecurity-Learning-Journey
I am a detail-oriented and proactive professional transitioning into cybersecurity, specializing in SOC analysis and ethical hacking. With a strong foundation in problem-solving, teamwork, and strategic thinking, I am committed to identifying vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and strengthening security frameworks.  

My core values—integrity, diligence, and resilience—align with cybersecurity’s key principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Through hands-on learning, security assessments, and continuous skill development, I aim to help organizations enhance their security posture and defend against evolving threats.  

I am eager to contribute my skills to an organization that values security, innovation, and proactive defense
